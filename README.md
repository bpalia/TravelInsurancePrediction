# Travel Insurance Prediction

The notebook `travel_insurance_prediction.ipynb` provides the analysis of [Travel Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data) containing information on almost 2000 customers who were offered a travel insurance package in 2019.

The **aim** of this work is to analyze Travel Insurance dataset and provide insights for a travel company.

The work **objectives** are as follows:
* Explore the dataset to identify relationships between variables;
* Formulate and test hypothesis to compare differences between customers who bought and did not buy travel insurance;
* Build a model to predict whether the customer will be interested in buying travel insurance.
